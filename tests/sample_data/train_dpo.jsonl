{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "chosen": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions.", "rejected": "Machine learning is just computers doing math."}
{"prompt": "Explain neural networks.", "chosen": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information through weighted connections.", "rejected": "Neural networks are just some computer stuff."}
{"prompt": "What is deep learning?", "chosen": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It's particularly effective for complex pattern recognition.", "rejected": "Deep learning means learning deeply about things."}
{"prompt": "How does gradient descent work?", "chosen": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts parameters to minimize a cost function by moving in the direction of steepest descent. It calculates gradients and updates weights proportionally to minimize error.", "rejected": "Gradient descent goes down gradients somehow."}
{"prompt": "What are transformers in AI?", "chosen": "Transformers are a neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. They revolutionized NLP by allowing parallel processing and capturing long-range dependencies better than RNNs.", "rejected": "Transformers are robots that transform into cars."}
